# Robust Rrder-based Machine Learning ROML framework

Built binary and multi-class classifiers for cancer subtypes

---

## Models

- Binary
- Multi-class
  - Model 1: one-vs-rest
  - Model 2: pairwise
  - Model 3: pairwise binary models + objective function


## Simulation

The results were not as expected...


## Real data application

- Breast cancer
  - RNA-seq: TCGA-BRCA
  - Microarray: MetaBric

- Colorectal cancer
  - RNA-seq: TCGA-COAD
  - Microarray: [KFSYSCC](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4974668)

TO DO (sep 2019):

Modify all CV and multi-class model 3 functions to parallel computing way
